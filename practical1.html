    <h2>About the Course</h2>
    <p>Full stack web development refers to the process of developing both client- and server-side software. That means you can expect anyone with "full stack" included in their job title to have expertise in several front- and backend languages and frameworks. On the frontend, mastery in HTML and CSS is a common requirement for the field. Developers also tend to use JavaScript, jQuery, or Angular when developing a browser platform. Concerning the backend, full stack development consists of programming servers and databases. A server might call for code in PHP, ASP, Python, or Node, while a database can accept languages like SQL, SQLite, or MongoDB.</p>
